"""Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) Collision Detection

Notes

Adapted from matlab function provided by Matthew Sheen (2016) at:
https://github.com/mws262/MATLAB-GJK-Collision-Detection/blob/master/GJK.m

In our implementation of the GJK algorithm, point c will be the oldest support
point selected, followed by point b, and lastly point a. This way, between
iterations, point a will become point b and point b will become point c.

    Notes
    -----
    If two convex shapes collide, then there exists a triangle formed from
    vertices of the Minkowski difference which contains the origin.

    Begin by initializing a flag indicating whether the generated triangle
    contains the origin – initialize as false.

    Generate the first support point using the first two points specified
    as arguments. This support point must be selected in the direction
    towards the origin, which is obtained using a triple product.

    Any triangle can be used to partition 2D space into seven Voronoi regions:
    a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, abc. If our triangle contains the origin, then the
    orgin is located in region abc. Because of the way we selected our three
    points of our triangle, we can eliminate certain regions as candidates for
    containing the origin – we eliminate regions a, b, c, bc. If our triangle
    contains the origin, then regions ab and ac do NOT contain the origin; to
    check that our triangle contains the origin, verify that this is the case.

    If region ab contain the origin, then the dot product of abp (perpendicular
    to side ab towards the origin) and ao (the vector from the origin to a)
    will be positive. Likewise, if region ac contains the origin, then the dot
    product between acp (perpendicular to side ac towards the origin) and ao
    will be positive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like (3,) of double
        Coordinates of the newer support point
    b : array_like (3,) of double
        Coordinates of the newer older point
    vertices_1 : array_like (M, 3) of double
        Array of vertices for first object, where the rows represent individual
