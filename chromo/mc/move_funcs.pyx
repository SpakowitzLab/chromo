# Crank Shaft Move

cpdef long[:] crank_shaft(

):
    """Rotate section of polymer around axis connecting two end beads.
    
    Notes
    -----
    The crank shaft move affects a continuous range of beads; the internal
    configuration is unaffected by the crank shaft move. Therefore, when
    evaluating polymer energy change associated with the move, it is sufficient
    to look only at the ends of the affected segment.

    Begin by randomly selecting a starting and ending index for the crank-shaft
    move based on the bead amplitude. Then generate a random rotation angle for
    the move based on the move amplitude. Obtain the axis of rotation from the
    change in position between the starting and ending beads. Finally, generate
    the rotation matrix and obtain trial positions and tangents for evaluation.

# Change Binding States

cpdef long[:] change_binding_state(
    poly.PolymerBase polymer, double amp_move, long amp_bead
):
    """Flip the binding state of a reader protein.
    
    Notes
    -----
    Before applying the move, check that the polymer has any reader proteins at
    all.

    Begin the move by identifying the number of binding sites that each bead
    has for the particular reader protein. Then randomly select a bead in the
    chain. Select a second bead from a two sided decaying exponential
    distribution around the index of the first bead. Replace the binding state
    of the selected beads.

    In our model, we do not track the binding state of individual tails. We
    care only about how many tails are bound. Therefore, for each move, we will
    generate a random order of bound and unbound tails and will flip the state
    of the first M tails in that order.

    This function assumes that polymers are formed from a single type of bead
    object. if different types of bead objects exist, then the first two
    if-statements that reference `bead[0]` will need to be generalized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    polymer : poly.PolymerBase
        Polymer object on which the move is applied
    amp_move : double
        Magnitude of the MC move; this attribute is included simply for 
        consistency with the other MC move functions and does not affect the

    amp_bead : int
